First, Make a new branch in your repository called
"`experimental_change`" by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git branch experimental_change
----

Then, use checkout to switch to the new branch

[source,bash]
----
git checkout experimental_change
----

The output should look like this:
<pre class="file">
Switched to branch 'experimental_change'
</pre>

Next, for the sake of demonstrating changes in Git, run the following
command to modify the files in your repository:

[source,bash]
----
#adds some text to the end of sample.txt
tee -a sample.txt << EOF
This is some addtional sample text. It is appended to the original sample.txt file.
EOF

#deletes helloworld.cpp
rm helloworld.cpp

#removes "World" from the output of helloworld.py and replaces it with "user"
sed -i 's/World/user/' helloworld.py
----

Finally, commit these changes to the experimental_change branch by
running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git commit -am "made random changes to all files"
----

The output should look like this:
<pre class="file">
[experimental_change 8f223de] made changes to all files
3 files changed, 2 insertions (+), 7 deletions(-)
delete mode 100644 helloworld.cpp
</pre>
