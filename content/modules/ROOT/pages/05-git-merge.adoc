You have made changes to your experimental_change branch and are now
ready to incorporate those changes into your main branch. To do this,
you will pull the changes to the main branch and then delete the
experimental_change branch. Additionally, when merging branches, you
must be in the branch that you want to apply the changes to. For
example, in this case, you will move into the main branch before merging
the experimental_change branch.

To initiate a merge of experimental_changeâ€™s changes into main, run the
following commands:

[source,bash]
----
git checkout main #moves back into the main branch
git merge experimental_change #pulls changes from experimental_change into main
----

The output should look like this:

Typically, merging works well, but if there are conflicts that could not
be resolved automatically, you will have to sort through them. This is a
broad topic, but you can learn more about it here:

Now that you have merged the branches, you are ready to delete the
experimental_change branch. To do this, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git branch -d experimental_change
----
